# Christian Brown

**Senior Engineering Manager**

*London, UK*

I'm a people manager and solutions architect with a background in online video workflows, content management systems and e-commerce, backed by two decades of experience with well-known, high-traffic, enterprise-level web properties that are created and maintained by globally distributed teams. I empower engineers to create high-quality, reusable, and maintainable solutions using SOLID design principles, automated testing, and continuous integration.
