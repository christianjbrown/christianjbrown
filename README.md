I'm a people manager and solutions architect with a background in world-class content management systems and online video workflows, backed by a decade and a half of experience with well-known, high-traffic, enterprise-level web properties created and maintained by globally distributed teams. Iâ€™m a strong proponent of high-quality, reusable, and maintainable solutions using SOLID design principles, unit testing, and continuous integration.
